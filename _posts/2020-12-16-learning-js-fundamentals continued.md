title: "Learning Javascript Fundamentals Continued"

date: 2020-12-16

Today I finally completed the learning Javascript fundamentals section on [the Udemy course I'm taking](https://www.udemy.com/share/101WfeAEYedFZW/). The biggest takeaway so far is -- I'm struggling with accepting that it is going to take time for these fundamentals to actually stick through continual practice. My normal approach is to just hack away at code until it works.

The good is that I approach things as a problem solver.

The bad is that I don't actually know why it works.

The ugly is that ... well .. the code can be ugly (kinda like this blog as of today).

My 2021 goal is to continue building things outside of console.log(); lol and possibly land a gig within the developer/designer realm.
