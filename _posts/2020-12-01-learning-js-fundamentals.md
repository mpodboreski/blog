Since my last writing I've switched gears a bit and went back to [learning Javascript on Udemy]([https://www.udemy.com/share/101WfeAEYedFZW/). The course has been updated to a more modern approach and I'd like to not play catch up with some things. I learned about let and const for variables, along with string and template literals. I'm also starting to pay more attention to things on the web and thinking about how they may have been implemented, as well as how I can utilize me new learnings on some projects I have in mind.
