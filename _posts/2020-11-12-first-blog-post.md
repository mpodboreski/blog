This is my first blog post within GitHub, and was created with the help of github's learning lab and jekyll. My goal is to try and commit a daily update and post about my learnings. I also want to start publishing any additional learning here and move projects from CodePen as practice using the tool. I do understand that life will get in the way sometimes and I may miss a day. This is ok. I need to respect it.
