title: "Progress Update"

date: 2020-11-20

I'm not much into writing, but I do try. I feel like it may just be something that eventually comes. Anyways, this week has been pretty intense at my day job. Being down a few people have left me with a little less energy and I did not make my initial intentions. But some progress is better than no progress.

I started reading and following along with Jon Duckett's, "Javascript and JQuery" book again. I learn better through books than video. What I like best about this book is that it goes into how JS interacts with a web page straight away.

Some other things I do is freecoding basic things as warm ups. This helps me keep what I learn to memory.
